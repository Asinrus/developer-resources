These guides and tutorials are designed to give you the tools you need to design and implement an efficient and flexible graph database technology through a good graph data model.

Best practices and tips gathered from Neo4j's tenure of building and recommending graph technologies will provide you with the confidence to build graph-based solutions with rich data models.
The focus of this section is to provide you with the necessary guidelines and tools to help you model your domain as a graph.

=== How to Create a Graph Data Model

To start, this guide will introduce the basic process of designing a graph data model and walk you through the first steps to create a graph data model, building upon the foundations of the property graph data model.

It will help you determine the questions you need to ask and share design considerations, best practices learned from experts through the years, and tips for building a more flexible and clean data model to structure your data model for the best results.


=== Translating an RDBMS Schema to Graph

Want to relate your existing knowledge of relational data models to the graph data model?
Or do you already have a relational model you want to convert to graph?
This guide will help you translate that existing ERD skill and design to a graph data model.

From typical process steps to conversion mappings, we will walk through how the process can differ and what tables and columns look like as a graph.


=== Optimizing Graph Data Models

Finally, your data model may be working, but you find that performance or other aspects are not giving you the quality you desired.
Believe it or not, your graph data model can affect queries and performance of your use case.

Learn how to improve your graph solution and maximize the capabilities of what is existing with recommendations for optimization techniques and ideas.
