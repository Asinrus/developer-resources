== Introduction

Graph algorithms are used to compute metrics for graphs, nodes, or relationships.

They can provide insights on relevant entities (centralities, ranking) in the graph or inherent structures such as communities (community-detection, graph-partitioning, clustering).

== Graph Algorithms Library

Neo4j Graph Algorithms is a library that provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j 3.x exposed as link:/developer/cypher/[Cypher^] procedures.

It currently contains implementations for the following algorithms:

== Installation

The easiest way to install the Graph Algorithms library is from the Neo4j Desktop, which you can download from https://neo4j.com/download/[neo4j.com/download^].

Once you've downloaded that and created a project you can scroll down to the `Plugins` section, and click `Install` for the Graph Algorithms, and then click `Install` again on the pop-up message.

For more detailed instructions you can read Jennifer Reif's blog post about https://medium.com/neo4j/explore-new-worlds-adding-plugins-to-neo4j-26e6a8e5d37e[adding plugins to Neo4j^].

If you want to deploy Graph Algorithms outside of the Neo4j Desktop you can follow the instructions below:

* Download the library from the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/releases[downloads page^] and put the jar into `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins`
* Add `dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*` to `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`
* Restart Neo4j

We're now ready to start using the graph algorithms.
Run the following query to check that the algorithms library has been picked up by Neo4j:

[source,cypher]
```
CALL dbms.procedures() YIELD name, signature, description
WHERE name starts with "algo"
RETURN name, signature, description
```

If we don't see any rows we'll need to revisit the installation instructions.

== Further reading

We have an https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/[Algorithms section^] in the user guide which goes into the history of each algorithm and the use cases for which they're applicable.

Our colleague Amy Holder has also written an excellent blog post - https://neo4j.com/blog/top-13-resources-graph-theory-algorithms/[The Top 13 Resources for Understanding Graph Theory & Algorithms^] - in which she lists some of her favorite books and online courses.
