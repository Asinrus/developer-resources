== Developer Guide Topic Overview

We cover a variety of topics - from understanding graph database concepts to building applications that interact with Neo4j to running Neo4j in production.

Videos, text, examples, and code are just some of the formats in which we deliver the information to encourage you and aid all learning styles.

== What is a Graph Database?

Connected information is everywhere in the world around us.
Neo4j was build to efficiently store, handle, and query highly-connected data in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model, you can represent your real-world, variably-structured information without a loss of richness.

== How to Use Neo4j

At Neo4j, we want to provide options to solve many different kinds of business and technical needs.
Our goal is that our products are simple and fit your use case, whatever it may be.

== Graph Data Modeling

The richness of graph data and the performance of your queries depends closely on how the data is modeled.
Data in Neo4j should resemble the real-world information and relationships, but data modeling focuses on understanding what questions the data will answer and what types of information you need from it.

== Cypher - a next-generation query language

We wanted to make querying graph data not only fun, but easy to learn, understand, and use for everyone.
That's why we created a human-friendly, declarative query language which uses ASCII-Art to represent visual graph patterns to find or update.

* link:/developer/cypher/procedures-functions/[User-Defined Procedures & Functions^]


== Data Import & Visualization

Whether you are looking to bring data into Neo4j or display it visually, Neo4j has a variety of tools and partner applications for these functionalities.
We want to maximize value by simplifying the import/export processes and make it easier to review and make decisions with your data.

== Language Drivers

Developing applications using Neo4j is straightforward.
Starting with Neo4j 3.0 and the new *binary "Bolt" protocol*, we provide officially-supported drivers for *.Net, Java (also Spring), JavaScript, and Python*.
Other drivers for the binary and the http protocol are developed by our active contributor community.

== Extensions & Integrations

Neo4j is supported by a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, drivers and guides provided by partners, users and community contributors.
We want to allow users the ability to use familiar technologies and minimize pain associated with a rip-and-replace approach to solutions.
This area continues to expand as the technology ecosystem and developer needs consistently grow.

== Neo4j in Production

If you are looking to run Neo4j in production environments, we have all the tools necessary.
Neo4j provides options for causal clustering, performance tuning, cloud deployment, backups and failovers, and more.
There is even a calculator to help you know how much hardware you will need to run your data in Neo4j.

== Neo4j in the Cloud

There are a number of companies that provide hosting of Neo4j instances in the cloud.
Each implementation will have its own advantages and difficulties, but the power to choose resides in the business and technical needs of your company.
