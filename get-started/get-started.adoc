== What is a Graph Database?

Connected information is everywhere in our world.
Neo4j was build to efficiently store, handle and query highly connected elements in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model you can represent your real-world, variably structured information without a loss of richness.
The property graph model is easy to understand and handle, especially for object oriented and relational developers.

== From Relational to Neo4j

These guides explores the differences between relational and graph databases and their data models.
In addition, we show how to integrate graph databases with relational databases and how to import data from a relational store.

== Cypher - a next-generation Query Language


We wanted to make querying graph data not only fun, but easy to learn, understand and use for everyone.
That's why we created a human friendly, declarative query language which uses ASCII-Art to represent visual graph patterns to find or update.

// TODO Cypher in 60' 
* link:/docs/cypher-refcard/current/[Cypher Reference Card]
// * {manual}#graphdb-neo4j-schema[Optional Schema]

In 2015 http://openCypher.org[openCypher] launched as the open source project for developing the specification, reference-implementation and TCK of Cypher independently of Neo4j.


== Language Drivers

Developing applications using Neo4j is straightforward.
Starting with Neo4j 3.0 and the new *binary "Bolt" protocol*, we provide officially supported drivers for *.Net, Java (also Spring), JavaScript and Python*.

Other drivers for the binary and the http protocol are developed by our active contributor community. 

The following pages help you to work with Neo4j using your preferred programming languages and stacks.
