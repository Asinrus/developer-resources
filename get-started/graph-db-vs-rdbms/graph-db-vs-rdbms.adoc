== Relational Databases

Relational databases have been the power-horse of software applications since the 80s, and continue as such to this day.
They store highly-structured data in tables with predetermined columns of specified types and many rows of the same type of information. Due in part to the rigidity of their design, relational databases require developers and applications to strictly structure their data.
Although not every use case is a good fit for this type of stringent data model, in the past, the lack of viable alternatives and the widespread support of relational databases has made it difficult for alternative models to break into the mainstream.

As demonstrated by the image below, relational databases aggregate/retrieve data from other rows and tables (JOINS) by referring to primary-key attributes via foreign-key columns.
This is enforceable with constraints, but only when the reference is never optional.
The joins are computed at query time by matching primary and foreign keys of the many (possibly indexed) rows of the joined tables.
These operations are compute- and memory-intensive and have an exponential cost, especially as the complexity of the JOINS increase.

If you use many-to-many relationships (e.g. Departments can have many People, a Person can be in multiple Departments), you have to introduce a _JOIN_ table (or associative table) that holds foreign keys of both participating tables.
This further increases join operation costs, which are often mitigated by de-normalizing data to reduce the number of joins necessary. However, de-normalizing only aids so much and also sidesteps the structured design of relational databases.

Enter graph databases.

=== Uncover the Graph in a Relational Database

Connect the rows of tables in a *Relational Database* by uncovering all the relationships, and you'll see a graph.
Dumb JOIN tables are replaced by interesting relationships.

Where a RDBMS is optimized for aggregated, highly structured data, Neo4j is optimized for highly connected heterogeneous data.

.Relational databases also lack relationships
[quote, "Jim Webber, Ian Robinson", "Graph Databases, O'Reilly"]
For several decades, developers have tried to accommodate connected, semi-structured datasets inside relational databases.
But whereas relational databases were initially designed to codify paper forms and tabular structures--something they do exceedingly well--they struggle when attempting to model the ad hoc, exceptional relationships that crop up in the real world. +
*Ironically, relational databases deal poorly with relationships. Relationships do exist in the vernacular of relational databases, but only as a means of joining tables.*

== From Relational to Graph Databases

Relationships are first-class citizens of the graph data model, unlike other database management systems, which require us to infer connections between entities using special properties such as foreign keys or out-of-band processing like map-reduce.
By assembling the simple abstractions of nodes and relationships into connected structures, graph databases enable us to build sophisticated models that map closely to our problem domain.
In some regards, graph databases are like the next generation of relational databases, but with valuable support of the relationships between the data.

Each node (entity or attribute) in the graph database model directly and physically contains a list of relationships that represent its connections to other nodes.
These relationship records are organized by type and direction and may hold additional attributes.
Whenever you run the equivalent of a _JOIN_ operation, the database simply uses this list and has direct access to the connected nodes, eliminating the need for a expensive search-and-match computation.

This ability of materializing relationships from database structure during the storage process (rather than at query time) allows Neo4j to perform queries faster than other types of databases by several orders of magnitude. There is an even greater performance gain for join-heavy queries - the _minutes to milliseconds_ advantage that many users leverage with Neo4j.
The resulting data models are also much simpler and more expressive than those produced using traditional relational or other NoSQL databases.

Graph databases models are very flexible and fine-grained, allowing you to model and manage rich domains in an easy and intuitive way.

* Flexible: the data can be kept and modified to match what is in the real world: small, normalized, yet richly-connected entities.
These individual entities and relationships of a graph model allow you to query and view your data from any imaginable point of interest, supporting many different use-cases.
Data separated from a rigid table structure also makes changes to the model much faster and easier. This provides flexibility both in viewing and changing data models.

* Fine-grained: since there is no fixed boundary around aggregates, so the scope of update operations is provided by the application during the read or write operation.
Transactions group a set of updates to nodes and relationships into an atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) operation, a well-known and widely tested concept.
Graph databases like Neo4j fully support the transactional capabilities, including write-ahead logs and recovery procedures after abnormal termination.
This ensures you never lose your data that has been committed to the database.

If you're used to modeling with relational databases, you know the beauty a well-organized, normalized entity-relationship diagram - a simple, easy-to-understand model you can quickly whiteboard with your colleagues and domain experts.
A graph is exactly that - a clear model of the domain, focused on the use cases you want to support.
We refer to Neo4j (and graph databases, in general) as being white-board friendly. This is because the whiteboard model of your data is exactly how it is stored in a graph database.
This visual model is different from the tabular, structured form of a relational database.

Let's model an organizational domain dataset, starting with a relational entity-relationship diagram model, and then show how it would be transformed to a graph model.

=== Data Model Transformation

Now let's model this as a high-level graph. Here are some tips to guide you in the transformation:
- Each row in an entity table is a node. While we won't graph to this detail here, it is helpful to visualize.
- Columns on each table are node properties.
- Each entity table is assigned as a label on nodes (e.g. "Department" becomes a label on Accounting node, Development node, Marketing node, etc).
- Technical primary keys (those added only to make data unique) are removed, business primary keys are kept.
- Unique constraints for business primary keys are added, as well as indexes for frequent lookup attributes.
- Foreign keys to other tables are replaced with relationships to the appropriate nodes.
- Data with default values is removed, no need to store it.
- Data in denormalized tables (duplicated) is potentially pulled out into separate nodes to get a cleaner model.
- Indexed column names can indicate an array property (like role in Project_Members, since a member may have several roles).
- Join tables are transformed into relationships and columns on those tables become relationship properties.

Does your new graph model look similar to the one below? If it doesn't, do not fear. We devote an entire upcoming section to data modeling. You will have opportunity to practice and perfect your skills.
It is important to have an understanding of your graph model before importing data, so that you can focus on enriching that model through the relationships most valuable to your use case.

== SQL vs. Cypher

Querying relational databases is easy with SQL - a declarative query language that allows users to execute easy, ad-hoc queries in a database tool, as well as specified, use-case-related queries in application/program code.
Even object-relational mappers use SQL under the hood to talk to the database.

Do graph databases have something similar? Yes!
Cypher, Neo4j's declarative graph query language, is built on the basic concepts and clauses of SQL but has graph-specific functionality that makes it easy to work with your graph model without being verbose.
It allows you to query and update the graph structures with concise statements.
Cypher is centered around the graph patterns that are core to your use cases, and its query syntax represents those patterns visually.

If you have ever tried to write a SQL statement with a large number of joins, you know that you quickly lose sight of what the query actually does due to all the syntactical jargon.
In Cypher, the syntax stays clean and focused on domain concepts, with the query actions (to MATCH or CREATE) expressed logically.
Clauses other than pattern matching are very similar to SQL, so those parts of the query may look familar.

Let's show a real example of SQL vs. Cypher. In the organizational domain depicted in the relational model above, what would a SQL statement that lists the _employees in the "IT Department"_ look like, and how does that statement compare to a Cypher statement?

.SQL Statement
[source,sql]
----
SELECT name FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Person_Department
  ON Person.Id = Person_Department.PersonId
LEFT JOIN Department
  ON Department.Id = Person_Department.DepartmentId
WHERE Department.name = "IT Department";
----

.Cypher Statement
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)<-[:EMPLOYEE]-(d:Department)
WHERE d.name = "IT Department"
RETURN p.name;
----

== Importing Data from a Relational Database

When you have a good understanding of the shape of your graph model - i.e. what data will be represented as nodes or relationships and how the labels, relationship-types, and attributes are named - you're ready to go.
The easiest way to import data from your relational database is to create a CSV dump of individual entity-tables and join-tables.

Then you can take the CSV file(s) and use Cypher's `LOAD CSV` power tool to accomplish the following tasks:
* Ingest the data, accessing columns by header name or offset.
* Convert values from strings to different formats and data types (`toFloat`, `split`, ...).
* Skip rows that should be ignored.
* `MATCH` existing nodes based on attribute lookups.
* `CREATE` or `MERGE` nodes and relationships with labels and attributes from the row data.
* `SET` new labels and properties or `REMOVE` outdated ones.

For example, let's take a look at a sample csv file and the coinciding Cypher import statement.

.persons.csv:
[source,csv]
----
name;email;dept
"Lars Higgs";"lars@higgs.com";"IT-Department"
"Maura Wilson";"maura@wilson.com";"Procurement"
----

.Cypher:
[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV FROM 'file:///data/persons.csv' WITH HEADERS AS line
FIELDTERMINATOR ";"
MERGE (person:Person {email: line.email}) ON CREATE SET p.name = line.name
MATCH (dep:Department {name:line.dept})
CREATE (person)-[:EMPLOYEE]->(dept)
----

You can also import multiple CSV files from one or more data sources to enrich your core domain model with other information that might add interesting insights and capabilities.

Other, dedicated import tools help you transfer larger volumes (10M+ rows) of data efficiently, as discussed in the link:/developer/working-with-data[Working with Data] guides.
