== Installing and Starting Neo4j

To get started interacting Neo4j, we will use Neo4j Desktop. This application gives developers a single developer license for a "mission control" for Neo4j.
Desktop includes a license for Neo4j for servers that will run on the desktop, allowing a user to easily interact with the graph. Desktop can also be used to maintain instances of Neo4j for servers that may be hosted elsewhere.

First, if you haven't already downloaded and installed Neo4j Desktop, you can do so link:/download[here].http://neo4j.org/download[here].

Using the provided instructions (shown when downloading), follow Step 1 to install and start the Neo4j Desktop application. Instructions can also be found in the readme (`bin/neo4j start`) after unzipping the downloaded file.
Step 2 on the download page instructions shows you how to set up your first project and database and how to open the Neo4j in the browser.

****
[NOTE]
Please remember the password. 
If you forget it, you have to remove the credentials file in `data/dbms/authorization`.
****

Just to review, so far, we have shown two ways to interact with Neo4j.
      1) From Neo4j Desktop, you can open Neo4j Browser. This is done my clicking <your project name> in the Desktop screen, then click 'Manage' on your database.
      2) You can also access this from a regular browser window by typing http://localhost:7474 and signing in with Username: neo4j, Password: <your database password (set up in Desktop)>.

Now that we can access the graph database, we can start working with data using our query language, link:/developer/cypher[Cypher].
// tag::guide[]

For an introduction to Browser's features and navigation as Neo4j's user interface, you can type `:play intro` into the command-line and press kbd:[Enter] or click the play button (image::{img}cypher_run_button.jpg[]).

== Feedback & Questions

If you have feedback or questions on how to use the Neo4j Browser, there is a small messaging system in the configuration (icon:cog[]) drawer.
You can provide your name and send us a message.

== Neo4j Browser Sync

Neo4j Browser Sync is a feature that allows you to synchronize your favorites, styling, and settings to cloud storage, so you can share it across machines and browsers.
You just need to click the cloud icon in the left-side menu and log in with your GitHub, Twitter, or Google account to activate it and synchronize your workplace to the cloud.

== Built-in Guides

If you want to learn more about Neo4j, Cypher, or the Neo4j browser first, click on any of the helpful links shown after startup (commands also shown below) - these are quick guides that introduce the different concepts.
You can find more helpful links in the left sidebar of Neo4j in the "Documents" tab (icon:book[]).

|===
|Title |Description |Command
|Intro |A guided tour of Neo4j browser |`:play intro`
|Concepts |Graph database basics |`:play concepts`
|Cypher |Neo4j's graph query language introduction |`:play cypher`
|The Movie Graph |A mini graph model of connections between actors and movies |`:play movie graph`
|The Northwind Database |A classic use case of RDBMS to graph with import instructions and queries |`:play northwind graph`
|Custom Guides |Starting with Neo4j 2.3, you can use `:play <url>` to play a custom guide |`:play http://guides.neo4j.com/graphgist/restaurant_recommendation.html` 
|===

All you have to do is enter any of the above commands in the browser command line (at the top) and follow the accompanying guides to walk through the training or scenarios.
If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to contact us!
To execute any of the queries provided within a browser guide, simply click on the query, and it will populate in the browser command line.
Then all you have to do is press Enter or the Play button to execute the statement! Results of the query will populate in a panel right below the command line.
////
Import our sample movie graph by entering `:play movie graph`.

On the second slide click the large Cypher +CREATE ...+ statement, then hit the triangular `Run` button.

After a few seconds the data is imported, and you'll see a subset of the movie data rendered as a graph.
////

== Styling Neo4j Visualization

As mentioned above, any queries you run in Neo4j Browser will populate your results below the command line.
Query results are rendered either as a visual graph, a table format, or an ascii-table result. You can switch between those with the icons on the left side of the result frame.
If you cannot see the whole graph or the results display too close together, you can adjust by moving the visual view and dragging nodes to rearrange them.
To move the view to see more parts of the graph, just click an empty spot within the graph pane and drag it. To rearrange nodes, you can click and drag them around.

The nodes will already have sensible captions assigned by the browser, which will auto-select a property from the property list to use as a caption.
You can see all the properties of that element if you click on any node or relationship. Properties will appear below the visualization. Larger property sets might be collapsed into a subset, but there is a little triangle on the right to unfold them.

For example, if you click on one of the Movie nodes in the MovieGraph (`:play movie graph`), then you can see it's properties below the graph visual. The same applies for Actor nodes or the `ACTED_IN` relationships.
If you click on any label or relationship *above* the graph visualization, you can then choose its styling in the area below the graph.
Colors, sizes, and captions are selectable from there.

To see this for yourself, you can click on the `Person` label above the graph and change the color, size, and captions of all nodes labeled with `Person`.
The first image below shows changes to nodes labeled `Person`. The second image shows changes to relationships labeled `ACTED_IN`.

== Query and Command-Line Tips
////
When you continue with the guide, you will see more queries.
You can get them into the editor _by clicking on them_. 
To execute, hit the triangular play button.

Query results are rendered either as visual graph, tabular or ascii-table result.
You can switch between those with the icons on the left side of the result frame.
////
You can remove all accumulated output frames with `:clear`. The 'X' button at the top right of each pane removes that frame and will abort that statement (if it's running long).
The maximum number of frames that are kept is configurable in the Browser Settings from the left-side menu.

If you want to review a past query, you can find the result pane and click the query above the graph visualisation to pull it back into the editor.
The keyboard shortcuts listed above will help you work efficiently within the editor area.
You can also write and edit multi-line queries by switching to multi-line editing mode with kbd:[Shift+Enter], then kbd:[Enter] will create newlines.

kbd:[Ctrl+Up] and kbd:[Ctrl+Down] (Mac users, use the Cmd key) allows you to navigate command history, and you can access all command history with `:history`.
The command history is persisted across browser restarts.

You can switch between Graph, Table, Text, and Code views to see the results in various formats by clicking the icons on the left of each pane.

[NOTE] 
Don't worry if you don't see any output. You might just be in Graph mode, but had your query return tabular/scalar data. To see the results, just switch the mode to the Table view.

Query time is reported in the Table or Code views (*don't rely on that exact timing though*), and it includes the latency and deserialization costs, not just the actual query execution time.

You can also download the results as a CSV from the Table, Text, and Code views (top right download icon in the pane), or download the graph as an SVG or PNG from the Graph view (download icon above the panel, choose either SVG or PNG).

If you enter fullscreen mode of a graph visualization, you can zoom in and out.
After a node is clicked, it gets a halo, where you can expand and remove nodes from the visualization.
You can also turn previously dragged nodes loose again.

== Graph Metadata

In the left-side menu, the top icon is the database section (icon:database[]), where you can find the *currently used* node labels, relationship types, and property keys.
Clicking on any one of those options runs a quick query to show you a portion of those elements in the graph.

== Setting Favorites

If you currently have an empty frame, you can choose a query from the Graph Metadata section above to display some nodes and relationships, then click the Favorites (icon:star-o[]) icon to the right of the command line.
This will add the query to your Favorites list in the left-side menu. To run one of your Favorites, click on the left-side menu Favorites, choose the query, and run it.
////
The browser helpfully also fetches and displays relationships between those nodes, *even if they were not part of your query result*.
You can disable the latter behavior with the "Auto-Complete" switch in the bottom right corner.
Then only relationships returned by the actual query will be shown.
////
You can save your own queries as favorites by "starring" them. 
To provide a title or helpful info, you can use a comment `// comment` above your query to provide a title.
Creating folders can help organize your favorites, and you can rearrange them by dragging or delete them if they are no longer useful.

[NOTE]
Your favorites, settings, and styles can be saved to the cloud with Neo4j Browser Sync.
If you clear your browser cache, your local favorites will be removed.
////
== Advanced Styling

////

For more advanced styling, you can bring up the style-viewer with `:style`, download the graph-style-sheet (GRASS), edit it offline, and drag it back onto the drag-area of the viewer.

[NOTE]
You can reset to the default styles with `:style reset` or by clicking the "fire extinguisher" icon in the popup from `:style`.

Within the GRASS file, you can change colors, fonts, sizes, outlines and titles per node label and relationship type.
It is also possible to combine multiple properties into a caption with `caption: '{name}, born in {born}';`

////
== Configuration

* There is a configuration option on the left-side menu
* You can retrieve the current configuration with `:config`
* Individual settings are configured with the following defaults:
** `:config maxNeighbours:100` - maxiumum number of neighbours for a node
** `:config maxRows:100` - maximum number of rows for the tabular result

The defaults for all the settings can adjusted at any time.

== Executing REST requests

You can also execute REST requests with the Neo4j in the browser. The command syntax is +
`:COMMAND /a/path {"some":"data"}`.
The available commands are `:GET`, `:POST`, `:PUT` and `:DELETE`.

A simple query like `:GET /db/data/` inspects the available endpoints of the database, with the returned results formatted in JSON.
You can retrieve all labels in the database with `:GET /db/data/labels`.

To execute a Cypher statement, you post to the transaction Cypher endpoint like this:
[source,javascript]
----
:POST /db/data/transaction/commit {"statements":[
     {"statement":"MATCH (m:Movie)  WHERE m.title={title} RETURN m.title, m.released, labels(m)",
      "parameters":{"title":"Cloud Atlas"}}]}
----

There are endless possibilities to send and retrieve data using REST.
In a later guide, you can create an application to interact with Neo4j and use REST endpoints for interaction between you and the database.
