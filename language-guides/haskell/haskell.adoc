=== Hasbolt

Haskell driver for Neo4j 3+ (BOLT protocol).

The package covers:

* Data serialization and deserialization
* Nodes, relationships and paths support
* Cypher queries and responses
* Authentification

The code was tested with neo4j versions 3.0 and 3.1.

The https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-movies-haskell-bolt[example movie database application] uses https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty[Scotty] as a web framework and comes with detailed documentation, including deployment instructions to Heroku.
