=== RNeo4j

RNeo4j was written by our own data scientists https://twitter.com/_nicolemargaret[Nicole White^], to combine the analytics abilities of R with the interconnected data in Neo4j.
The RNeo4j package not only offers convenient access to Neo4j but also idiomatic integration with R the language and the R-Studio environment.

Nicole also detailed the usage in a number of blog posts and applications.

Compatible with Neo4j >= 2.0.
