[NOTE]
From Neo4j version 4.0 and onwards, the default encryption setting is *off* by default and Neo4j will no longer generate self-signed certificates when none is provided.
When connecting to a Neo4j server with encryption enabled, you must use the `neo4j+s` scheme in your connection string for a trusted certificate or `neo4j+ssc` for a self-signed certificate.
