.Goals
[abstract]
For Java developers who use the Spring Framework or Spring Boot, this guide introduces Spring integration but emphasizes the Spring Data Neo4j library.
The library provides convenient access to Neo4j including object mapping, Spring Data repositories, conversion, transaction handling, etc.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database^] concepts and the property graph model.
Having link:/download[installed Neo4j] and tried out the link:/developer/cypher[Cypher query language^] helps too.
You should also be familiar with Spring.
Knowing https://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data^] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot^] are both great additions to your toolbox, as well.
When developing with Neo4j, please use JDK 8 and your favorite IDE.

=== Neo4j for Spring Users

image::{img}sdn.png[float="right"]

Neo4j offers a rich set of possibilities for developers using Spring.
If you are looking to use Neo4j on the JVM in general, check out our link:../java[Java Developer's Guide^].

If you want to benefit from full-fledged Object Mapping and the other helpful support that comes with Spring Data, use *Spring Data Neo4j*.

Neo4j's Spring Data integration was the founding project of the Spring Data efforts, started by Rod Johnson and Emil Eifrem.
It integrates tightly with the http://spring.io/[Spring Framework^] and offers Object-Graph Mapping (OGM) on top of Neo4j.

It is based on the link:../neo4j-ogm[Neo4j-OGM^] a plain Java Object-Graph-Mapper and integrates in the http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data^] infrastructure, including Spring Data repository and annotated object-mapping support.

Spring Data Neo4j is also supported by Spring Boot.
You can use the https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr page^] to get started with Spring Data Neo4j immediately.

=== Spring Data Neo4j

Though Spring Data Neo4j has been around for a long time, Neo4j's APIs and usage evolved quickly from an embedded Java-only database to a server solution with mostly link:/developer/cypher[Cypher^] interactions.
At that point, we made the decision that a clean slate and reimplementation of the library was the best approach to embrace the modern Neo4j architecture.
In a joint effort with our partner http://graphaware.com[GraphAware^], the all-new Spring Data Neo4j library was developed and tested by existing users.

To use Spring Data Neo4j, all you need is the Spring Data Neo4j dependencies and a few annotations to use the object-graph mapping.
Then, you can annotate your entities and define Spring-Data-Repositories as convenient interfaces to your persistence layer.

==== Features

* Spring Boot Integration
* annotation-based object-graph mapping
* interface-based repository support with annotated and derived finder methods
* fast class metadata scanning
* optimized management of data loading and change tracking for minimal data transfers
* multiple transports: *binary protocol*, HTTP, and embedded
* persistence lifecycle events

==== Quickstart

Spring Boot takes on much of the responsibility of application configuration and bootstrap, so we have chosen to take advantage of that assistance in our project, as well.
The example project code for https://github.com/neo4j-examples/movies-java-spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j^] is checked in to GitHub.
You can clone the repository and run the code along with this guide, or you can build the project from the ground up from the http://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr^] page.
For this approach, you can follow along with a https://medium.com/neo4j/spring-into-neo4j-with-spring-data-5-spring-boot-2-and-neo4j-3962fb1ea067[blog post^] for step-by-step instructions.

The dependency for Spring Data Neo4j needs to be added in order to use the capabilities.

.Spring-Data-Neo4j dependency
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The entities outline our main objects in the application.
In our graph, they will be the nodes.

image::{img}GraphModel.png[]

There is a `Person` entity and a `Movie` entity, so a domain class for each is needed.
In each case, the class is annotated with `@NodeEntity` to use these objects as nodes in the graph.
Each contains an _id field_ that is annotated as the `id` and populated with a value generated by the database (`@GeneratedValue`).
After the `id`, additional fields are set up to hold different information we want to capture about the object.

The last few lines of each class map the relationship between the nodes.
Reference fields in both the `Person` and `Movie` classes are annotated with `@Relationship` and the type of relationship as `ACTED_IN`.
The direction property is _outgoing by default_, so we must specify that the relationship is incoming on the `Movie` node.
To capture additional attributes about the relationship between the two entities, a new relationship entity called `Role` is created for `Person` to be connected to `Movie` by the `Role` he/she played.
This class, we annotate as a relationship entity and specify the name of the relationship (`ACTED_IN`).
The `Role` class also has an _id field_ that is managed by the database and a list to contain the possible roles that a person could play in a movie (could be more than one).
Finally, annotations are added to mark the `Person` and `Movie` nodes as _start-_ and _end-nodes_ for the relationship.
We now have our graph structure mapped in our application. 
This is the object-graph mapping (OGM) piece.

.Entities
[source,java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Person {
   
   @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
   private String name;
   private int born;

   @Relationship(type = "ACTED_IN")
   private List<Movie> movies = new ArrayList<>();
}

@NodeEntity
public class Movie {
   
   @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
   private String title;
   private int released;
   private String tagline;

   @JsonIgnoreProperties("movie")
   @Relationship(type = "ACTED_IN", direction = Relationship.INCOMING)
   private List<Role> roles;
}

@RelationshipEntity(type = "ACTED_IN")
public class Role {

    @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
	private List<String> roles = new ArrayList<>();

	@StartNode
	private Person person;

	@EndNode
	private Movie movie;
}
----

The repository interface allows the developer to create methods and queries needed for retrieving the data from the database.

The interface extends the `Neo4jRepository`, which extends the Spring CRUDRepository for persisting and retrieving data.
With the `CRUDRepository`, a lot of CRUD methods (such as `findOne`, `findAll`, `save`, `delete`, etc.) come already out-of-the-box.
So, without even having to specify any method, basic data access is provided.

In the following sample, you see two different kinds of custom methods.
Some are defined in a specific pattern so that the queries can be derived for us (like the `findByTitle` method).
Others must be specifically written and annotated with `@Query`.
For more information, see the Spring Data Neo4j page and choose the latest https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/[documentation link^] on the right side of the page.

.Declare a repository interface
[source,java]
----
public interface MovieRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Movie, Long> {

    Movie findByTitle(@Param("title") String title);

    Collection<Movie> findByTitleLike(@Param("title") String title);

    @Query("MATCH (m:Movie)<-[r:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person) RETURN m,r,a LIMIT {limit}")
    Collection<Movie> graph(@Param("limit") int limit);
}
----

The next section of code uses our repository methods in the `MovieService` class.
The class starts by annotating it as a regular service with `@Service`. 
Then, the `MovieService` class injects the `MovieRepository` using a constructor.

Annotating these methods with `@Transactional` and read-only allows the smart client to efficiently route and execute the statements.
In each method, the specified method is queried from the `MovieRepository` interface and results are returned to the service caller.

.Use repository
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MovieService {

    private final MovieRepository movieRepository;
    public MovieService(MovieRepository movieRepository) {
        this.movieRepository = movieRepository;
    }

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public Movie findByTitle(String title) {
        return movieRepository.findByTitle(title);
    }

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public Collection<Movie> findByTitleLike(String title) {
        return movieRepository.findByTitleLike(title);
    }

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public Map<String, Object>  graph(int limit) {
        Collection<Movie> result = movieRepository.graph(limit);
        return toD3Format(result);
    }
}
